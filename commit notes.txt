file provisioners seem tricky and arent best practice. I should probably be using userdata. Or S3

I have been manually running build.yaml on the instance and it fails to install gluster. Upon investigating, the service hasnt/wont start. Nmap shows that the only port open is 22. I can't find firewalld, iptables, or nftables on the system. Installing iptables and opening everything wide open doesn't do it. What am I missing?
